I've run it for twenty hours continuously before deciding it was starting to dim. The nice thing about LEDs is the light stays white unlike a filament-type bulb. The light from this device is more than adequate when I'm out on a dark night. Then my phone charger replenishes it once it runs down. The flashlight switch does stick up just a little bit so it is possible for it to be inadvertently switched on (push-on/push-off) while in a pocket or pack.<br /><br />For recharging purposes, the battery capacity in this device is small. Although the battery capacity is spec'd at 2600 MaH, you will never get that amount into the device you are charging. The process of up-converting the charger's battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) to the USB standard (5 vdc) and back down to battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) in the device being charged results in some losses. A good budgetary figure is to plan on transferring 70% of the source battery capacity into the device being charged. So if your phone's battery is spec'd at 2500 MaH, you will need at least a 3600MaH battery in your charger to fully charge the phone's battery. This is true for all battery-driven chargers, not just this one. Or you can shop for a charger whose battery capacity is 150% of the device you need to fully charge - it's that simple.","31/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",43493634,"R2OC0E4X4RISOB","B011W26BU2",938399424,"Bluetooth Speakers, SoundPal Cube F1 5 Watt Bluetooth Speaker Compatible with all Bluetooth Devices","Mobile_Electronics",3.0,0.0,3.0,"N","Y","... speaker from another maker and this one was very easy to use but the volume up louder doesn't sound ...","I have another Bluetooth speaker from another maker and this one was very easy to use but the volume  up louder doesn't sound as good as the other one.","31/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",48689977,"R2F2BCP1CC8VKZ","B005LF67OC",71624801,"BestDealUSA Universal Am-Fm Am Fm Hidden Windshield Antenna Car Radio","Mobile_Electronics",5.0,0.0,0.0,"N","Y","Five Stars","X x vc&#34;ccc","31/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",3962209,"R174DGBVW0UWAJ","B00W2S9MBG",805170833,"Pioneer 6.2\" Double DIN 2DIN Touchscreen AM/FM DVD MP3 WMA CD Player USB Bluetooth with JDM 170Â° Rear View Back-up Camera","Mobile_Electronics",5.0,0.0,0.0,"N","Y","Five Stars","Sounds awesome and works great, pioneer coming in clutch.","31/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",26081688,"R2074W1A28UUU6","B00XKM57WQ",168739839,"Dashboard Camera, SplashETech Mini 0806 Dash Cam *World's Smallest Dashcam W/ Screen* Amba A7LA50 + OV4689, HDR, Full HD 1296P, Car Video Recorder, Dvr Car Camera with GPS Logger + MLC TF Card","Mobile_Electronics",5.0,9.0,11.0,"N","N","Everyone should have this","This is my first Dashcam and I love it!

I bought them when I did because we were going to take a family trip and I wanted to have something in the car to keep devices charged on the go.  I received these two days before we left, but really didn't get to use them until the trip.  Then, just two days in to the trip, the pins on both sides turned black and the cable STOPPED working.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but other cables I've used in the same way (especially the one that came with my iPhone 5c) have worked WITHOUT ISSUE.  Needless to say, just two days in to our trip and we are down a cable, I was more than a bit peeved.<br /><br />If you purchase these from this seller, it is at your own risk and will be a complete gamble.

There are some issues though: (1) if you already have a large rear view mirror the placement of the camera lens may not allow you to position it correctly in your case; (2) the power cord is a bit shorter than other mirror cams that I own - barely reaches around the edges of my 07 Equinox; (3) basically no manual - and any English is a bit difficult to get - requires about 30 minutes of hunting and pecking through the menu and you will find it has lots of features;  (4) the screen is brighter than most but the coating on the reflective surface is a slightly different color than the screen really take some getting used if you look into your mirrors often; (5) has a super bright LED that blinks every other second.  During the night it lightens up my whole SUV - I put a sticker over it now it seems.  I have hooked up the included rear view cam, but looks pretty standard.

That's okay because I'm putting this in my old Chevy pickup and if it gets stolen some day I didn't want to be out a bunch of money. The camera works. Now, here's my only complaint so far - this is quite possibly the most unbelievably bad manual I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad it's actually funny. The camera has three modes: video (called &#34;shooting&#34;), photos, and File management (playback). Got it, not a big deal. Now for the recording video there are a couple options that would be nice to control - like auto shake and auto night mode. Here's what the manual says, &#34;The camera start to record automatic when it is open up, press OK key to stop recording which pressed again to restart recording, press up and down key in recording model to save electricity Press up and down key in recording model for mode switch in day and night, night scene is open fill-in light.&#34; Yeah. That's typed verbatim. So, the up and down key &#34;save electricity&#34; and &#34;mode switch in day and night&#34; in &#34;recording model&#34;. Despite trying about a dozen things, all I can get the up and down keys to do are zoom in and out the camera. That was starting to get kind of frustrating because the fill lights were staying on and there was no way to turn them off or convince the camera to go out of night mode. Finally I resorted to a system reset which quite helpfully switched all the menus to Chinese and (amazingly) turned off the the night mode and associated fill light. Yay. There is also a G sensor (maybe that's the anti-shake?) that ambiguously offers me 2G, 4G, 8G, and OFF. I tried 2G and OFF in the hopes that it would reduce the number of times I thought, &#34;Gee, I have no idea how this option is supposed to work&#34; but alas, my &#34;Gee&#34; count continued to rise. Motion detection? Okay.....well, that's nice, but since it's in a car won't there almost always be motion? I was happy though to find out that &#34;You can press reset and starting up the product when a crash happened because disoperation, it will get right.&#34; Thank goodness!

From that moment forward, I realized that I needed a dependable recorder and began searching several local consumer outlet stores for this product.  After a couple of weeks without having any success at locating such an antiquated device, I turned to Amazon.com.  To my amazement, this iconic store offered an assortment of cassette player/recorders at affordable prices.  Within five days after ordering a portable recorder, I obtained what I thought was a compatible replacement for my old Panasonic.  However, to my dismay, I found issues with the replacement recorder's volume control and built-in microphone and had to return the item.  When I resumed my search for a dependable cassette player/recorder that functioned as advertised, I was fortunate to find the Jensen product offered by Todays Concept.  This portable cassette player/recorder is worth every penny I spent.  It is compact, lightweight and easy to operate.  The record/play/rewind/fast fwd/stop/eject and pause buttons do not stick when pressed, which is a plus for baby boomers like me who suffer with arthritic stiff fingers.  Although the recorder's built-in condenser microphone functions adequately, for acute clarity of sound I recommend using the external microphone with stand that is included with the recorder.  I assure you, this small microphone is powerful enough to record your inner thoughts, if you are so inclined to articulate them.  I rate this product as 4 and one half stars.","28/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",12956836,"RBX6BG5QKEHD2","B00QERR5CY",82850235,"iXCC Multi pack Lightning cable","Mobile_Electronics",5.0,0.0,0.0,"N","Y","works great! fits iPhone 6 with no problems","works great!  fits iPhone 6 with no problems.","28/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",2649879,"R33IRFFLJRBTL3","B0064DRKIC",216839275,"Wfco Products Main Board Assembly 55A 8900 Series WF-8955MBA","Mobile_Electronics",5.0,0.0,0.0,"N","Y","Works great.","Used this for two side by side freezers instead of a fridge/freezer combo unit.

Not very loud, however, as such things go.  At max, a moderate listening level.<br /><br />Fit/Build profile:  Has rubber feet for vertical positioning, yet plays well horizontally - just be aware that also covers the funky, oddball, what-on-earth Volume, Track AND Power all on a single hybrid slide dial & push button thing that did indeed befuddle me for a few minutes.  All the instructions say is \\\\\"Turn It On\\\\\".  Great.  It wasn't until I was fooling with that tiny little thing and happen to press against it that I realized you are supposed to long press it in (like a good three seconds at least) to turn it on/off.  And its a pretty tiny slot, not to mention I can see beefy fingers (like one brothers) having a frustrating grapple with it.  This is my main hit.<br /><br />Bluetooth Signal Reception Strength:  On par, through major obstructions, such as walls.<br /><br />Battery Life: It does not disclose an official battery life, even in the instructions.  However, it disclose the use of a 1050mAh battery, so I would estimate 6-8 hours continual play, depending on volume.  This is average for this size of speaker, so neither good nor bad.<br /><br />Additional Observations:  Upper ring around that huge Play/Pause/Answer button (makes that tiny gnome-designed thing on the bottom even smaller in comparison) is a soft, blinking blue when in use.  Turns red while charging, and the red does turn off when full.  Does show the battery life meter on my iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1).  Nice mesh carrying case.<br /><br />Summary:<br />So it had the audio goods, and I like the overall form factor of it.

I don't listen at max volume and got around 3-4 hours off a charge.<br />  The charging speed depends on the charger you use (it has nothing to do with the cable).  It charges in an hour or 2 with my nice 2 amp charger and takes much longer plugged into a laptop or standard phone charger.  This is standard for any device being charged by USB so don't blame the speaker if it takes forever to charge.<br />  The sound quality is decent.  Not a lot of bass but it's much better than the speakers that come on your cellphone and a lot louder as well.<br />  The suction cup on mine was awesome.  I stuck it to my windshield in the south Georgia heat for more than 2 weeks and it didn't fall off. (my car radio doesn't have bluetooth and I was listening to Pandora on a road trip)<br />  The volume level changes in small increments.  I have had other bluetooth audio devices that increment in large steps so you go from not quite loud enough to way too loud.  This one has small steps so it's easy to find the right audio level.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />  Definitely not &#34;Waterproof&#34; more like &#34;Water Resistant.&#34;  I purchased this for music while Kayaking.  It got splashed a little and didn't seem adversely affected, but it got dunked and started acting weird.  It kept powering on and off again.

Gym perfection.","Fantastic device. I use this everyday. They have much improved the sound quality since the earlier days of Beats, and it is a godsend at the gym not having to deal with wires.<br /><br />----Pros---<br />-Easy Bluetooth connectivity: All you have to do is turn it on and it will automatically connect to the device that you last used with it, provided it is in range. If not, it will default back to any previously paired devices<br />-Great sound: while not as HQ as some of my more audiophile headphones, this is more than listenable, especially for Rap and EDM, music with a heavy bass element that is perfect for the gym<br />-Micro USB plug for charging: This is an absolute must, and huge upgrade over previous models that used AAA batteries.<br />-Build quality: solid build quality. I sweat into them regularly at the gym and it seem to have no effect on the audio quality or the headsets reliability (I bought the 3 year square trade warranty just in case though).  The phones themselves are made of some kind of plastic, but it feels solid and durable.<br /><br />---Cons---<br />-Could use a little more range: sometimes I find myself losing connection momentarily or music stuttering when running to the other basket on a basketball court, when my phone is sitting under the opposite hoop<br />-Battery life: while the battery life is admirable for the package you get, it would be a lot more convenient if the battery life was up to par with a device like the LG Tones. I do love the Micro USB plug for charging though.<br />-Pricey: this is a bit pricey, but I feel the cost is worth it for how well the package you receive works. But thats my opinion and I know some people do not share it. Because of the price I recommend purchasing some kind of Square trade warranty. I bought a 3 year one, just in case my sweating at the gym eventually kills it.","27/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",1004131,"R3N6GR9YN7JN6O","B00U6XT81S",123054482,"Rerii 1 Meters / 3ft USB and 3 RCA to USB and 3.5mm Female Flush Mount For Car, Boat and Motorcycle, One Year Warranty, FAST Delivery Guarantee(Fulfilled By Amazon, Normally Can receive in 3 days)","Mobile_Electronics",1.0,0.0,0.0,"N","Y","One Star","Noisy, ineffective.

My uncle owns a parking lot so it was always a great problem for them to communicate with employees. Since they got this BaoFeng radio communication has become so much better.Below are few facts and things that i like about these Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.<br /><br />-  When you turn the device on, a voice says &#34;Power On&#34; and then speaks the channel number. As you change channels, it speaks the channel you just selected. That is very useful and makes things much easy,<br />-  Very durable, light weight and comfortable to hold.<br />-  Power-saving features to extend battery life.<br />-  Features Include CTCSS/DCS function, Scanning function, Emergency alarm, VOX, TOT and Monitor Functions.<br />-  They are also programmable through PC.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping:  The radios came very nicely packaged in the box which contain: Two radios, Two antenna, Two Li-ion battery pack, Two charger, Two  belt clips, Two slings and User's manual. The shipping was also very fast, i got the BaoFeng radio in two days after placing the order. The price is very reasonable for such a great quality. Luckily i bought them at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am glad that i did because these BaoFeng radios are very well build, light weight and operationally, they perform quite well. I definitely recommend this Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.

They don't come with a microSD card but the generic one I got from Wal-Mart is working perfectly. Navigating between the radio and the player is easy and well explained in the directions. The volume is the best (or worst if you have a kid who loves to blast their drums out) part. when you turn the radio up to max volume, you can hear it fine even from your lap. I love that the radio finds all the presets for you as your move from one area to the next. It found all the available stations in MI, then in CO when we went and then in AZ so my son could enjoy the radio even before we were able to load up his microSD with songs.<br /><br />Just make sure your young ones protect their ears when listening to the radio and MP3 player because the volume gets pretty loud. As headphones they aren't as loud, at least I never heard them when he was using them to play on the android tablet or his handheld thingamajig...Sega I think it is?<br /><br />I love that it functions well as ear phones and as an mp3 player and as a radio. Usually multipurpose devices sacrifice quality for the convenience of an all in one but that is not the case here. Not to mention that it's foldable and the cord detaches so the cord itself can essentially double to attach the earphones to say your car's speaker so that what's on the SD card can be heard by everyone.

E-Prance Dash cam back in May to replace my crappy old standard definition with no useful features","I ordered this E-Prance Dash cam back in May to replace my crappy old standard definition with no useful features. On paper this one looked great and had all the features I wanted. Super wide angle lens, GPS tracking, Speed tracking, super high definition, etc. Overall I've been very pleased with it but it has one major flaw that is simply irredeemable and prevents a 5 star rating. That flaw is it's stupid patented GPS suction-cup mount. At first I was willing to overlook this minor annoyance but after a few months it's proved to be a royal pain in the butt. What ends up happening is over time it gets loose, this is especially true if you move the dash cam from one vehicle to another a few times or simply adjust the angle (not a lot, I've only moved it about 6 times).  What this means is that when you go over a few bumps in the road or around a corner to fast the entire camera unit moves. That perfect camera angle you spend 10 minutes setting up is lost. This wouldn't be a big deal if it used a standard suction cup mount where you can adjust the tightness of the swivel and the up and down motion. Not the case with their suction cup mount, there is no adjustment. You have literally no way to lock the camera into position. Lets say I wanted to for whatever reason point the camera out my windshield facing the sky, I can't do that because the mount is so loose and it will quickly fall into a lower position facing my dashboard.<br />I'd originally overlooked what now seems like an obvious feature to have in such a pricey dash camera... I'm super pleased with everything else this camera does and has to offer but.... I don't know, I guess I'll just continue taking great HD video of my dashboard and a few feet in front of where I'm driving.","22/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",42532274,"R2S4XKV164VN6I","B01416742A",642884794,"Powerful Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with High Quality Hands-free Speakerphone, Rechargable Battery, Connects to Any Device Though Bluetooth/aux","Mobile_Electronics",1.0,1.0,1.0,"N","N","This Bluetooth speaker is awful.  The sound quality is horrible.","I want to first start out by saying that I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review of the product.  With that said, even at a discount, this speaker is not worth it, allow me to tell you why.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 1 Star<br />Since Sound Quality is obviously the most important part of a bluetooth speaker, I figured I'd start my review by talking about how awful the sound quality is on this speaker.  You can only really turn the volume up halfway before the speaker starts distorting.  Not only that, but if the speaker is at full volume, the vocals are almost not audible because of so much distortion.  Just based off of the Sound Quality portion of my review, I would say definitely do not purchase this speaker.  It was not the discounted price, and it definitely is not worth the full price.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY - 3 Stars<br />The Build Quality was middle of the road.  Nothing to immediately complain about, nothing to write home about either.  The Design itself is edgy and modern which is nice.  The usb and 3.5m jacks feel solid enough.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY - 3 Stars<br />The Bluetooth connectivity is very mediocre.  It started disconnecting at 25 feet when I walked just outside of my house.  It's good if you keep it near by.<br /><br />OVERALL - 1 Star<br />This bluetooth speaker is not worth it's $40 price tag.  It's also not worth the discounted price I got it for.

And this program is about as far from â€œsimpleâ€ as any software Iâ€™ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  Itâ€™s â€œEZ Nav Route Wizardâ€ is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their &#34;features&#34;, but itâ€™s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, thatâ€™s their way of giving it to you.  However, Iâ€™m baffled by why, if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re after, youâ€™re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says â€œFly to Chicagoâ€.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, weâ€™re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we donâ€™t need the dash of a 777 to do it.<br /><br />If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, youâ€™re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard â€“ so much so that thereâ€™s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but arenâ€™t sure what order to put them in, or lets say youâ€™re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and youâ€™re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stopâ€™s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the stepsâ€¦  make sure youâ€™re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop youâ€™d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Prefâ€™s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a &#34;start&#34; button on the thing. And for good measure, letâ€™s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those â€“ theyâ€™re way too useful.<br /><br />My bottom line for this software is youâ€™re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesnâ€™t do a good job at ANY of them.  Youâ€™re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and Iâ€™m still looking.  If thatâ€™s what youâ€™re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isnâ€™t apparently in this software teamâ€™s vocabulary.  And if youâ€™re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it atall, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software Iâ€™ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.all, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software Iâ€™ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.

I personally do not drive down the freeway or down the street in reverse so I only needed this camera for when I back up in a parking lot or parking in reverse which I do maybe 2 to 4 times a day and it usually takes me 5 seconds to 10 seconds max. I was just looking for a camera to make sure I don't hit a shopping cart, a kid, another persons car or a person in a bike cus we all know they never lookout for themselves. Overall the camera serves it's purpose which is what I was looking for, a rear-view camera at an affordable price. I wasn't expecting full H-D when I ordered this and don't need it for something that I may spend a total of 40 seconds a day looking at ,if that. The quality of the camera is good during the day and at night it's pretty good too, I have LED lights for my reverse lights so that does help. I also liked that it had a little grid so I know where I'm going. The camera came with a drill bit to drill the perfect size hole in my car which I really appreciated, it also came with the needed power cable and video cable. For me it was really easy to install since I have installed stereos and monitor in my cars in the past and also have installed audio and video in my home so it took less then 30 minutes and that's only because I'm the type of person that likes to have a nice professional looking install and don't like having wires all over the place.

DON'T BUY","This has the potential to be a great inexpensive dashcam, but two flaws are ruining it for me:<br />1. Despite what the product pictures show, the camera has a BRIGHT silver lens barrel, not the more subtle black one show in the pics. This would be a minor cosmetic issue, except for the fact that the silver barrel makes this SUPER OBVIOUS if you leave it mounted to your windshield when your car is parked. It's like the damn thing was designed to be enticing to thieves. I contacted Amazon about this and they sent me a second one, which (despite the pics on the site and the product box) also sports the bright silver color. Annoying, but fixable with a Sharpie and some time.<br />2. The dashcam broke within a couple weeks of installing it. It works for about 3 minutes before powering off completely, and refuses to power up again until the power cord is completely disconnected and re-inserted (hardly safe while driving). I've heard good things from trusted sources about this camera so I'm hoping this is just a fluke and hopefully the soon-to-be-received replacement will be awesome, but this early and sudden failure (coupled with the issue noted above) doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Wanted to provide an update. About ~15 months after purchasing the original and then getting the replacement because the 1st one was DOA, the second camera is broken. It powers on and I can &#34;use&#34; it as you'd expect, but it no longer records reliably to memory cards (I've tried with different known-good cards formatted in-camera). Super frustrating to find out that it stopped recording files to the card months ago, despite all the icons on the LCD display indicating everything is working fine. Naturally it is just outside the manufacturers warranty now, so I've got an $89 paperweight. I strongly encourage you to skip this camera and buy something else - this one is junk. :-(","17/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",28710645,"R35Z3EQEEDOW65","B00XTLMKX2",438245684,"Silicone Case for Microsoft Lumia 640 XL - X-Style blue - Cover PhoneNatic + protective foils","Mobile_Electronics",5.0,0.0,0.0,"N","Y","It fits perfectly!

Im glad that this unit is so clear.<br />-You can play DVD's.....<br /><br />That's as far as I can go with the standouts.<br /><br />The issue i have for this is that, I cant really imagine many people using the DVD feature anymore, considering DVD or any kind of CD device is outdated technology, especially if you have a smart phone that you are connecting to this device. I bought this unit thinking I might be able to play youtube, and other video files on the screen. ONCE AGAIN PLAYING VIDEO/MEDIA FILES FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE CANNOT BE DONE WITH THIS UNIT! I have to capslock that statement in case people are thinking that this 2015 model unit would have that feature.<br /><br />In my defense I searched the pioneer's main website prior to purchasing to get some more details about this product. It had a little ad that showed the phone app that you can download to use with pioneer headunits. I mistakenly took that ad as a feature for this specific unit. That app does not work for this unit, unless someone can show me otherwise.<br /><br />Hope this helps a few of you guys.","17/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",6396777,"R2HXDQ10CW6QJW","B00J46XO9U",744008282,"iXCC Lightning Cable 3ft, iPhone charger, for iPhone X, 8, 8 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 6, 6 Plus, SE 5s 5c 5, iPad Air 2 Pro, iPad mini 2 3 4, iPad 4th Gen [Apple MFi Certified](Black and White)","Mobile_Electronics",5.0,0.0,0.0,"N","Y","Five Stars","They work great!","17/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",14324509,"R2SBDZLSOO0XHS","B00OX52T1Q",86915277,"Clip-Dat Blue Mini Clip MP3 Player w/ Black Button - Assembled, QC Tested, & Imaged by FairlyAdept -  Same Day Processing","Mobile_Electronics",4.0,1.0,1.0,"N","N","when they finally go bad, I will recycle them","Got 3 of them, all work as advertised, when they finally go bad, I will recycle them.

Some lasted 3 days: none served me for more than a month before breaking.  And most cost at least twice as much as this gold all-metal BT speaker that looks like the interchangeable lens for an SLR camera.<br /><br />In short, this is the only non-brand, inexpensive BT speaker that I could recommend and that I might give as a gift.  The audio quality is loud enough and decent for a speaker of this size, and the speaker has proven durable, lasting me for an entire year.<br /><br />Of course, there are a few caveats: You should not expect to hear much bass (or, for that matter, anything close to full-frequency sound).  Also, any reference to an FM radio is unlikely to have any relevance in the West, where all you're likely to receive is static.  Finally, my &#34;pre-2014&#34; version of this speaker charges with a &#34;mini SD&#34; connector (commonly used to transfer images from a digital camera to computer) instead of the more common &#34;micro SD&#34; connector.","17/08/2015",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],["US",34446441,"R1E8NAV25W65ZN","B00MJCDPM2",754171872,"Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black)","Mobile_Electronics",5.0,0.0,1.0,"N","N","My favorite speaker for the price- you can't go wrong!","Whenever I review an electronic, especially one dealing with audio output, people always wants to compare a high end unit to a value brand, when, in fact, its apples to oranges.I don't use my Infinity One portable speaker for the same sound output, situations, or locations as I do my JBL Charge 2. While part of it has to do with one being valued at almost triple the other- the majority of my reasoning is in the strengths one device has over the other. And yes, even in a much lower end device you are bound to find applications more suited to a $100 speaker than a $300 one. While one may deliver crisp expansive audio, the other may have a significantly longer battery standby life, for example.<br /><br />Primarily, for us, this bluetooth speaker has an appeal in the range of features it boasted at such an expendable price point. No one wants to hear their product is 'expendable,' but our brand loyalty to Sentey comes mostly from their execution of easy to use, functional, gaming products under a $50 price point. The convenience of Bluetooth devices lie in the portability of the product, and the vary nature of being portable puts a tech device in harms way from circumstances such as theft, water damage, and improper use (especially if your devices are used in communal circumstances.) While I would love to take my Infinity One to work at the marina and in the golf cart, my paycheck can't afford any mishaps around water or sticky hands from teenage skateboarders. In that case, I desire portable audio that is quick to setup, long lasting in life, and durable in design- with a price point under $50- so here we are testing the Sentey Bluetooth 4.0:<br /><br />Yays:<br /><br />*We always start with packaging- This speaker looks like it could have just come off Best Buy's shelf- It was packaged in a sturdy box inside an outer packaging sleeve. Not only did the box seem like it could withstand shipping and even continual storage, it was colorful and informative, something you don't often see in a value tech brand.<br /><br />*The design is very attractive- many 'bargain' bluetooth speakers come in bright gaudy colors that look and feel cheap- or targeted towards tweens. The slick black facing and 360 speaker design is very modern and style friendly for any geographic or setting. I love how the buttons on the top are inlaid under the rubber coated material so the speaker's operation is quite intuitive and seamless. While this speaker is not waterproof in a sense it could fall into water, the buttons on the top are all beneath the facing, so one could handle it with damp or wet hands without worry (this would be great in a kitchen when working on a recipe.)<br /><br />*This speaker includes a complimentary carry case, which you will want to use because the rubberized top and bottom coating seems to scuff easily. The case fits a little snug and has a drawstring close.<br /><br />*A big plus for me was the ability to play while plugged in- and the device even seemed to maintain or gain a charge while playing and charging. This mainly means I can use it as a stationary speaker in my office for an entire day without having to fuss with it.<br /><br />*Bluetooth pairing was quick, my devices located it on the first scan and there was no searching or fancy button configurations- simply turn it on and put your streaming device in Bluetooth discovery mode.<br /><br />*The product advertises up to 33 feet of connection thanks to Bluetooth 4.0 technology. This is a direct line of path claim- with minor obstructions such as furniture and a dresser, we maintained about a 15 foot connectivity. I COULD keep connectivity through the wall but this was a pretty direct proximity, best estimated at 8 to no more than 10 feet. When outside with no obstructions we successfully measured 30 feet of crisp, uninterrupted transmission.<br /><br />*I like that there is a direct on/off switch so there is never confusion about whether the speaker is on or off- this helps save battery life.<br /><br />*Speaking of battery life- This DOES have exceptional battery life for the value and clarity. On a full charge of Bluetooth wireless radio app streaming we've clocked 7 hours and 50 minutes play time.<br /><br />*The sound is stereo with 2 5 watt drivers for 10 watts total at about 125-250hz audio output. The bass on this speaker is fairly impressive for the price and size but not the same caliber as high output speakers you'd find over $200. In general, this speaker does beautifully with layered audio and instrumental heavy tracks- vocals can sound a little tinny at times (illustrated on the devices bluetooth calling feature) but in general what this device lacks in precision clarity (and don't get me wrong, it's great audio for the price range) it makes up in volume. Oh so very much volume. I can fill an entire veranda or pool deck with the output from this single portable speaker.<br /><br />Mehs:<br /><br />*While it seemed to turn 'on' out of the box, it would not pair- This is because it had no prior or residual charge. In general it's a pet peeve of mine when electronics don't include batteries, or a partial charge. No one wants to open a gift and have to wait hours to play with it.<br /><br />*Charge time from empty to full was long for a device of this size and output- it took nearly 3 hours (2 hours 45 minutes) to charge out of the box.<br /><br />*The upper and bottom material is a rubberized grip that is soft and slick but seems to scuff very easy.<br /><br />*The included cables aren't the highest quality or length. If you are an audiophile you likely have better quality cabled laying around- the charging cable, in particular fit a little snug for my liking. We use our own cables for aux and charging.<br /><br />*This claims to deliver big sound without the bulk- I feel it is one of the more bulky bluetooth speakers I own, especially for amp and bass output. Bulky can be a good thing, especially when you plan on using the speaker outdoors ad in social stations often. Bulky, in this case, also means it has weight in the hand and feels like it is built well- however, it certainly is not a dainty speaker.<br /><br />*It's hard to determine when you are done charging the speaker, and there's no real way to know how many hours or what percentage of battery life you have left. A visual queue or different colored light/patterns would be nice.<br /><br />In summary, this product performs at a believable range for it's list price of $69, and we've found it a great deal for the current asking price of $34 with prime. I like that this speaker has more of a presence than some of other other 'micro and portable bluetooth audio options and feel confident enough in the product that I would gift one to any casual to moderate music lover. I received a product discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts and experiences, which I have done.for the value and clarity.

The control works, but it is small and could get lost if one is not careful.  The capacity for sound is limited.  Also the cables to connect the speakers were flimsy and not working properly.  Overall very disappointed with this purchase.  I contacted amazon for return and found out that we are responsible for shipping costs with this seller. I Found out the cheapest UPS ground services to be after packaging close to $30.00! This is crazy to have to pay this for a defective product.

I've run it for twenty hours continuously before deciding it was starting to dim. The nice thing about LEDs is the light stays white unlike a filament-type bulb. The light from this device is more than adequate when I'm out on a dark night. Then my phone charger replenishes it once it runs down. The flashlight switch does stick up just a little bit so it is possible for it to be inadvertently switched on (push-on/push-off) while in a pocket or pack.<br /><br />For recharging purposes, the battery capacity in this device is small. Although the battery capacity is spec'd at 2600 MaH, you will never get that amount into the device you are charging. The process of up-converting the charger's battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) to the USB standard (5 vdc) and back down to battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) in the device being charged results in some losses. A good budgetary figure is to plan on transferring 70% of the source battery capacity into the device being charged. So if your phone's battery is spec'd at 2500 MaH, you will need at least a 3600MaH battery in your charger to fully charge the phone's battery. This is true for all battery-driven chargers, not just this one. Or you can shop for a charger whose battery capacity is 150% of the device you need to fully charge - it's that simple.</td><td>31/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>43493634</td><td>R2OC0E4X4RISOB</td><td>B011W26BU2</td><td>938399424</td><td>Bluetooth Speakers, SoundPal Cube F1 5 Watt Bluetooth Speaker Compatible with all Bluetooth Devices</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>3.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>... speaker from another maker and this one was very easy to use but the volume up louder doesn't sound ...</td><td>I have another Bluetooth speaker from another maker and this one was very easy to use but the volume  up louder doesn't sound as good as the other one.</td><td>31/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>48689977</td><td>R2F2BCP1CC8VKZ</td><td>B005LF67OC</td><td>71624801</td><td>BestDealUSA Universal Am-Fm Am Fm Hidden Windshield Antenna Car Radio</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>X x vc&#34;ccc</td><td>31/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>3962209</td><td>R174DGBVW0UWAJ</td><td>B00W2S9MBG</td><td>805170833</td><td>Pioneer 6.2\" Double DIN 2DIN Touchscreen AM/FM DVD MP3 WMA CD Player USB Bluetooth with JDM 170Â° Rear View Back-up Camera</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Sounds awesome and works great, pioneer coming in clutch.</td><td>31/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>26081688</td><td>R2074W1A28UUU6</td><td>B00XKM57WQ</td><td>168739839</td><td>Dashboard Camera, SplashETech Mini 0806 Dash Cam *World's Smallest Dashcam W/ Screen* Amba A7LA50 + OV4689, HDR, Full HD 1296P, Car Video Recorder, Dvr Car Camera with GPS Logger + MLC TF Card</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>9.0</td><td>11.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Everyone should have this</td><td>This is my first Dashcam and I love it!

In most cases, we get what we expect.  I was skeptical in purchasing these and saw mixed reviews, but these guys claim to be &#34;Apple MFI Certified&#34; and are &#34;genuine&#34;.  Well...BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />I purchases these in early July, one for each vehicle so we can keep our phones charged.  I bought them when I did because we were going to take a family trip and I wanted to have something in the car to keep devices charged on the go.  I received these two days before we left, but really didn't get to use them until the trip.  Then, just two days in to the trip, the pins on both sides turned black and the cable STOPPED working.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but other cables I've used in the same way (especially the one that came with my iPhone 5c) have worked WITHOUT ISSUE.  Needless to say, just two days in to our trip and we are down a cable, I was more than a bit peeved.<br /><br />If you purchase these from this seller, it is at your own risk and will be a complete gamble.  I highly recommend to keep looking and steer clear of these guys.  The worst part now, is that I have passed the one month window to return these because once back from my trip, I've had to deal with some work emergencies.  So I've basically just wasted my hard earned money on garbage, with no more option for refund.</td><td>30/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>40085728</td><td>R2SAHVFOHVRMS8</td><td>B00MFM89XQ</td><td>686355048</td><td>Lumsing&reg; Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with NFC Built-in Microphone, Powerful Sound Rechargeable Battery up to 1 Day Playtime</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Do not buy!</td><td>Poor quality and low sound output for its size.

The video is clear and the mirror is fairly easy to install.  It has lots of features such as long battery life, motion sensor video mode, gps hook up (if you have your own) and plenty of options.  There are some issues though: (1) if you already have a large rear view mirror the placement of the camera lens may not allow you to position it correctly in your case; (2) the power cord is a bit shorter than other mirror cams that I own - barely reaches around the edges of my 07 Equinox; (3) basically no manual - and any English is a bit difficult to get - requires about 30 minutes of hunting and pecking through the menu and you will find it has lots of features;  (4) the screen is brighter than most but the coating on the reflective surface is a slightly different color than the screen really take some getting used if you look into your mirrors often; (5) has a super bright LED that blinks every other second.  During the night it lightens up my whole SUV - I put a sticker over it now it seems.  I have hooked up the included rear view cam, but looks pretty standard.  Overall though I am pretty pleased with this mirror and recommend that everyone have one if for nothing else other than an insurance policy.</td><td>30/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>6356913</td><td>RVQAD1KFHCUM</td><td>B00W00SH62</td><td>654171419</td><td>Ownmax NFC Waterproof 10w Wireless Sports Stereo Power Bank Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker for Iphone Samsung</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Dont buy not worth it.

I've had it for over a year now and the wire is still in excellent shape. No tears to the cable, like you often have with apple headphones or other chargers, plus the wire is still neat and clean hasn't really accumulated any dirt or smudges (I bought the white one so that says a lot). The cable also stays straight, i.e. it also doesn't tangle or twist into a knot that you need to untangle.

The body is a mixture of silicone rubber and high density plastic, with metal grills on the front, and a rubber strap for carrying.<br /><br />Outdoors, it won't scare away the livestock or set off seismic activity sensors but is perfect for a tent or a small room. As an added bonus you can insert a micro hard drive on the back and play your music directly from that, so it technically qualifies as an MP3 player, albeit one with minimal controls. It doesn't have any IPX proofing, so I would try and keep it away from water. Having said that for $15, you can take this to the swimming pool and should it get soaked you won't feel like you got um, soaked.</td><td>28/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>45286795</td><td>R2I7U743HBLIOM</td><td>B004A83PE6</td><td>683281404</td><td>6-Pack Mirror Screen Protector for Apple iPod Touch 4th Gen</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>Did the job</td><td>28/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>139230</td><td>RWEDYJ952QEPV</td><td>B00PGQY5CW</td><td>636384633</td><td>Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Wireless Speaker w/ Gray Soft Silicon Cover & Travel Bag - Bundle</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>you get great quality and sound from BOSE</td><td>As always, you get great quality and sound from BOSE !

That's okay because I'm putting this in my old Chevy pickup and if it gets stolen some day I didn't want to be out a bunch of money. The camera works. Now, here's my only complaint so far - this is quite possibly the most unbelievably bad manual I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad it's actually funny. The camera has three modes: video (called &#34;shooting&#34;), photos, and File management (playback). Got it, not a big deal. Now for the recording video there are a couple options that would be nice to control - like auto shake and auto night mode. Here's what the manual says, &#34;The camera start to record automatic when it is open up, press OK key to stop recording which pressed again to restart recording, press up and down key in recording model to save electricity Press up and down key in recording model for mode switch in day and night, night scene is open fill-in light.&#34; Yeah. That's typed verbatim. So, the up and down key &#34;save electricity&#34; and &#34;mode switch in day and night&#34; in &#34;recording model&#34;. Despite trying about a dozen things, all I can get the up and down keys to do are zoom in and out the camera. That was starting to get kind of frustrating because the fill lights were staying on and there was no way to turn them off or convince the camera to go out of night mode. Finally I resorted to a system reset which quite helpfully switched all the menus to Chinese and (amazingly) turned off the the night mode and associated fill light. Yay. There is also a G sensor (maybe that's the anti-shake?) that ambiguously offers me 2G, 4G, 8G, and OFF. I tried 2G and OFF in the hopes that it would reduce the number of times I thought, &#34;Gee, I have no idea how this option is supposed to work&#34; but alas, my &#34;Gee&#34; count continued to rise. Motion detection? Okay.....well, that's nice, but since it's in a car won't there almost always be motion? I was happy though to find out that &#34;You can press reset and starting up the product when a crash happened because disoperation, it will get right.&#34; Thank goodness! I hate it when I crash my car and it disoperates, but with a push of a button it will get right!</td><td>28/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52223478</td><td>R34M1NEAF69R87</td><td>B00SKPPY1W</td><td>742440014</td><td>[Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth Speaker] - Iselector NFC IPX6 Water Resistant Shock Proof and Dust Proof Outdoor / Shower / MP3 / PC Speakers with Build-in 2000mAh Battery for Apple iPhone iPad iPod, Samsung Galaxy, LG, Htc, Nexus Smartphones ,Tablets</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Great sound but lacks NFC functions</td><td>Pros:<br />Great size.

From that moment forward, I realized that I needed a dependable recorder and began searching several local consumer outlet stores for this product.  After a couple of weeks without having any success at locating such an antiquated device, I turned to Amazon.com.  To my amazement, this iconic store offered an assortment of cassette player/recorders at affordable prices.  Within five days after ordering a portable recorder, I obtained what I thought was a compatible replacement for my old Panasonic.  However, to my dismay, I found issues with the replacement recorder's volume control and built-in microphone and had to return the item.  When I resumed my search for a dependable cassette player/recorder that functioned as advertised, I was fortunate to find the Jensen product offered by Todays Concept.  This portable cassette player/recorder is worth every penny I spent.  It is compact, lightweight and easy to operate.  The record/play/rewind/fast fwd/stop/eject and pause buttons do not stick when pressed, which is a plus for baby boomers like me who suffer with arthritic stiff fingers.  Although the recorder's built-in condenser microphone functions adequately, for acute clarity of sound I recommend using the external microphone with stand that is included with the recorder.  I assure you, this small microphone is powerful enough to record your inner thoughts, if you are so inclined to articulate them.  I rate this product as 4 and one half stars.</td><td>28/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>12956836</td><td>RBX6BG5QKEHD2</td><td>B00QERR5CY</td><td>82850235</td><td>iXCC Multi pack Lightning cable</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>works great! fits iPhone 6 with no problems</td><td>works great!  fits iPhone 6 with no problems.</td><td>28/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>2649879</td><td>R33IRFFLJRBTL3</td><td>B0064DRKIC</td><td>216839275</td><td>Wfco Products Main Board Assembly 55A 8900 Series WF-8955MBA</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Works great.</td><td>Used this for two side by side freezers instead of a fridge/freezer combo unit.

Not very loud, however, as such things go.  At max, a moderate listening level.<br /><br />Fit/Build profile:  Has rubber feet for vertical positioning, yet plays well horizontally - just be aware that also covers the funky, oddball, what-on-earth Volume, Track AND Power all on a single hybrid slide dial & push button thing that did indeed befuddle me for a few minutes.  All the instructions say is \\\\\"Turn It On\\\\\".  Great.  It wasn't until I was fooling with that tiny little thing and happen to press against it that I realized you are supposed to long press it in (like a good three seconds at least) to turn it on/off.  And its a pretty tiny slot, not to mention I can see beefy fingers (like one brothers) having a frustrating grapple with it.  This is my main hit.<br /><br />Bluetooth Signal Reception Strength:  On par, through major obstructions, such as walls.<br /><br />Battery Life: It does not disclose an official battery life, even in the instructions.  However, it disclose the use of a 1050mAh battery, so I would estimate 6-8 hours continual play, depending on volume.  This is average for this size of speaker, so neither good nor bad.<br /><br />Additional Observations:  Upper ring around that huge Play/Pause/Answer button (makes that tiny gnome-designed thing on the bottom even smaller in comparison) is a soft, blinking blue when in use.  Turns red while charging, and the red does turn off when full.  Does show the battery life meter on my iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1).  Nice mesh carrying case.<br /><br />Summary:<br />So it had the audio goods, and I like the overall form factor of it.  Just a) not a crunking volume, and b) surely a more standard method of powering, volume, and track selection could have been used...<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.efully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.</td><td>27/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>11324071</td><td>R2T628MWOORD5L</td><td>B00J46XO9U</td><td>744008282</td><td>iXCC Lightning Cable 3ft, iPhone charger, for iPhone X, 8, 8 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 6, 6 Plus, SE 5s 5c 5, iPad Air 2 Pro, iPad mini 2 3 4, iPad 4th Gen [Apple MFi Certified](Black and White)</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Works great!</td><td>27/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>15214426</td><td>R3PQB4F1K68LXC</td><td>B00J46XO9U</td><td>744008282</td><td>iXCC Lightning Cable 3ft, iPhone charger, for iPhone X, 8, 8 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 6, 6 Plus, SE 5s 5c 5, iPad Air 2 Pro, iPad mini 2 3 4, iPad 4th Gen [Apple MFi Certified](Black and White)</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Three Stars</td><td>Quality is ok, but the cables tend to fray around the connection end fairly quickly.</td><td>27/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1159274</td><td>R2L7YRXTTLNWGG</td><td>B00N9KPAXU</td><td>205064806</td><td>SoundBotÂ® SB571 Bluetooth Wireless Speaker for 12 hrs Music Streaming & Hands-Free Calling w/ 6W + 6W 40mm Driver Speakerphone, Built-in Mic, 3.5mm Audio Port, Rechargeable Battery for Indoor & Outdoor Use</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Impressed</td><td>Got it in red and black and already in love with it.

I don't listen at max volume and got around 3-4 hours off a charge.<br />  The charging speed depends on the charger you use (it has nothing to do with the cable).  It charges in an hour or 2 with my nice 2 amp charger and takes much longer plugged into a laptop or standard phone charger.  This is standard for any device being charged by USB so don't blame the speaker if it takes forever to charge.<br />  The sound quality is decent.  Not a lot of bass but it's much better than the speakers that come on your cellphone and a lot louder as well.<br />  The suction cup on mine was awesome.  I stuck it to my windshield in the south Georgia heat for more than 2 weeks and it didn't fall off. (my car radio doesn't have bluetooth and I was listening to Pandora on a road trip)<br />  The volume level changes in small increments.  I have had other bluetooth audio devices that increment in large steps so you go from not quite loud enough to way too loud.  This one has small steps so it's easy to find the right audio level.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />  Definitely not &#34;Waterproof&#34; more like &#34;Water Resistant.&#34;  I purchased this for music while Kayaking.  It got splashed a little and didn't seem adversely affected, but it got dunked and started acting weird.  It kept powering on and off again.  The buttons are actually part of a rubber ring that goes all the way around the speaker.  I pulled the ring off and let it air dry and it works good as new.  It's worth the then bucks I paid but they should really change the description.<br />  The volume and track change buttons are the same buttons.  Long press for volume, short press to change tracks.  This can get annoying if you forget and tap the button trying to bump the volume up a bit (as happened to me frequently)</td><td>27/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>49911379</td><td>RQ6JB8KGZEAQC</td><td>B001P771LI</td><td>742029519</td><td>Case for Garmin Nuvi GPS 265W 855 260W 1350T 205W 1350LMT 1390LMT 295W 465T 1300 1300LM 1390T 255W 1370T 765T 885T 250W 755T 660 650 750+Screen Protector, Blue</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Works good as ever!</td><td>27/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>23826451</td><td>R1ORLB6LK8H1P7</td><td>B00ZFE4SBS</td><td>573072993</td><td>AweekÂ® Universal Waterproof 12V 4 Vehicle Parking Sensors Buzzer Car Reverse Backup Rear Radar Kit Alarm Indicator Probe, Black</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Nice item to install</td><td>[[VIDEOID:fc6d7c0266a602f5e8ce06be09c08539]]This back up alarm is good to have if you live in a busy city it helps out a lot.

Gym perfection.</td><td>Fantastic device. I use this everyday. They have much improved the sound quality since the earlier days of Beats, and it is a godsend at the gym not having to deal with wires.<br /><br />----Pros---<br />-Easy Bluetooth connectivity: All you have to do is turn it on and it will automatically connect to the device that you last used with it, provided it is in range. If not, it will default back to any previously paired devices<br />-Great sound: while not as HQ as some of my more audiophile headphones, this is more than listenable, especially for Rap and EDM, music with a heavy bass element that is perfect for the gym<br />-Micro USB plug for charging: This is an absolute must, and huge upgrade over previous models that used AAA batteries.<br />-Build quality: solid build quality. I sweat into them regularly at the gym and it seem to have no effect on the audio quality or the headsets reliability (I bought the 3 year square trade warranty just in case though).  The phones themselves are made of some kind of plastic, but it feels solid and durable.<br /><br />---Cons---<br />-Could use a little more range: sometimes I find myself losing connection momentarily or music stuttering when running to the other basket on a basketball court, when my phone is sitting under the opposite hoop<br />-Battery life: while the battery life is admirable for the package you get, it would be a lot more convenient if the battery life was up to par with a device like the LG Tones. I do love the Micro USB plug for charging though.<br />-Pricey: this is a bit pricey, but I feel the cost is worth it for how well the package you receive works. But thats my opinion and I know some people do not share it. Because of the price I recommend purchasing some kind of Square trade warranty. I bought a 3 year one, just in case my sweating at the gym eventually kills it.</td><td>27/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1004131</td><td>R3N6GR9YN7JN6O</td><td>B00U6XT81S</td><td>123054482</td><td>Rerii 1 Meters / 3ft USB and 3 RCA to USB and 3.5mm Female Flush Mount For Car, Boat and Motorcycle, One Year Warranty, FAST Delivery Guarantee(Fulfilled By Amazon, Normally Can receive in 3 days)</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>One Star</td><td>Noisy, ineffective.

Some mp3's are better quality than others depending on copy.  Equalizing automatic sound levels throughout various albums would ensure same levels.  Non of this has to do with AMP quality or output but more with music being used and how it was ripped.  LOVE THE LITTLE AMP.  One thing that would be nice is a headphone jack which is not available.

I've dropped it a couple times by mistake and the case has held up fine. No damage at all. I also appreciate that you can remove your phone from the case without tools and it does take some force to unsnap the front as it should. With some other cases, the front cover is too easily removed and sometimes would fall off when the phone was dropped. This case doesn't have that problem.

The sound absolutely fills up a small room easily...The only two possible improvements I wish for are 1) an ability to connect to another device by automatically disconnecting the previously connected one (this needs to be done manually for now) and 2) perhaps an ability to connect to two or three such speakers from a single device so that different tracks could be played on different speakers! Those two will make this a dream-come-true for me!<br /><br />I love the fact that it can be also used in the car essentially as a hands free system to receive calls (and I haven't tried but could be perhaps used with Siri/Google to make calls by talking into it) !<br /><br />The buying experience was also smooth & pleasant.

Also.. The screen that lights everything up at night gets dark spots. More and more of them.. When the car gets hot from being parked, the screen is worthless !!  At least at night it cools off and gets bright for all the thieves..  It is not that where I live there are lots of them, but when you go downtown or other places and park your car, why send it up the flag pole that you have a electronic device in your car !!  Heck.. Thieves would not know at a glance I only paid 20 bucks for this thing !! Heck the window they break to get it cost more !!!  Also.. The Suction device grabs the glass well, but the slider part that hooks to the actual Dash cam slides off around hard turns and the Dash Cam lands in your lap !!  I guess you could somehow reverse it so it lands in your girlfriends lap and you could then have an excuse for being grabby..  Not sure..

It is made with high quality materials. I love the fact the the radio is light weight and has a great grip. It is not heavy like Motorols that i used in past. My uncle owns a parking lot so it was always a great problem for them to communicate with employees. Since they got this BaoFeng radio communication has become so much better.Below are few facts and things that i like about these Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.<br /><br />-  When you turn the device on, a voice says &#34;Power On&#34; and then speaks the channel number. As you change channels, it speaks the channel you just selected. That is very useful and makes things much easy,<br />-  Very durable, light weight and comfortable to hold.<br />-  Power-saving features to extend battery life.<br />-  Features Include CTCSS/DCS function, Scanning function, Emergency alarm, VOX, TOT and Monitor Functions.<br />-  They are also programmable through PC.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping:  The radios came very nicely packaged in the box which contain: Two radios, Two antenna, Two Li-ion battery pack, Two charger, Two  belt clips, Two slings and User's manual. The shipping was also very fast, i got the BaoFeng radio in two days after placing the order. The price is very reasonable for such a great quality. Luckily i bought them at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am glad that i did because these BaoFeng radios are very well build, light weight and operationally, they perform quite well. I definitely recommend this Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.

They don't come with a microSD card but the generic one I got from Wal-Mart is working perfectly. Navigating between the radio and the player is easy and well explained in the directions. The volume is the best (or worst if you have a kid who loves to blast their drums out) part. when you turn the radio up to max volume, you can hear it fine even from your lap. I love that the radio finds all the presets for you as your move from one area to the next. It found all the available stations in MI, then in CO when we went and then in AZ so my son could enjoy the radio even before we were able to load up his microSD with songs.<br /><br />Just make sure your young ones protect their ears when listening to the radio and MP3 player because the volume gets pretty loud. As headphones they aren't as loud, at least I never heard them when he was using them to play on the android tablet or his handheld thingamajig...Sega I think it is?<br /><br />I love that it functions well as ear phones and as an mp3 player and as a radio. Usually multipurpose devices sacrifice quality for the convenience of an all in one but that is not the case here. Not to mention that it's foldable and the cord detaches so the cord itself can essentially double to attach the earphones to say your car's speaker so that what's on the SD card can be heard by everyone.

On paper this one looked great and had all the features I wanted. Super wide angle lens, GPS tracking, Speed tracking, super high definition, etc. Overall I've been very pleased with it but it has one major flaw that is simply irredeemable and prevents a 5 star rating. That flaw is it's stupid patented GPS suction-cup mount. At first I was willing to overlook this minor annoyance but after a few months it's proved to be a royal pain in the butt. What ends up happening is over time it gets loose, this is especially true if you move the dash cam from one vehicle to another a few times or simply adjust the angle (not a lot, I've only moved it about 6 times).  What this means is that when you go over a few bumps in the road or around a corner to fast the entire camera unit moves. That perfect camera angle you spend 10 minutes setting up is lost. This wouldn't be a big deal if it used a standard suction cup mount where you can adjust the tightness of the swivel and the up and down motion. Not the case with their suction cup mount, there is no adjustment. You have literally no way to lock the camera into position. Lets say I wanted to for whatever reason point the camera out my windshield facing the sky, I can't do that because the mount is so loose and it will quickly fall into a lower position facing my dashboard.<br />I'd originally overlooked what now seems like an obvious feature to have in such a pricey dash camera... I'm super pleased with everything else this camera does and has to offer but.... I don't know, I guess I'll just continue taking great HD video of my dashboard and a few feet in front of where I'm driving.</td><td>22/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>42532274</td><td>R2S4XKV164VN6I</td><td>B01416742A</td><td>642884794</td><td>Powerful Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with High Quality Hands-free Speakerphone, Rechargable Battery, Connects to Any Device Though Bluetooth/aux</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>This Bluetooth speaker is awful.  The sound quality is horrible.</td><td>I want to first start out by saying that I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review of the product.  With that said, even at a discount, this speaker is not worth it, allow me to tell you why.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 1 Star<br />Since Sound Quality is obviously the most important part of a bluetooth speaker, I figured I'd start my review by talking about how awful the sound quality is on this speaker.  You can only really turn the volume up halfway before the speaker starts distorting.  Not only that, but if the speaker is at full volume, the vocals are almost not audible because of so much distortion.  Just based off of the Sound Quality portion of my review, I would say definitely do not purchase this speaker.  It was not the discounted price, and it definitely is not worth the full price.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY - 3 Stars<br />The Build Quality was middle of the road.  Nothing to immediately complain about, nothing to write home about either.  The Design itself is edgy and modern which is nice.  The usb and 3.5m jacks feel solid enough.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY - 3 Stars<br />The Bluetooth connectivity is very mediocre.  It started disconnecting at 25 feet when I walked just outside of my house.  It's good if you keep it near by.<br /><br />OVERALL - 1 Star<br />This bluetooth speaker is not worth it's $40 price tag.  It's also not worth the discounted price I got it for.  And it's all because of how poor the actual sound quality is.

The ability to pair to your phone simply by tapping the phone to the speaker is ingenious.....LOVE THAT part.</td><td>21/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13647366</td><td>R1IILT5R4ZD8YA</td><td>B007UXNHGY</td><td>666314203</td><td>Insten Universal Car Audio Cassette Adapter Compatible with Huawei Google Nexus 6P Samsung Galaxy S6/S7/S8 Edge Samsung Galaxy Note 4 / HTC One M7, Black</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Great...no complaints a year or more later.</td><td>21/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>17130045</td><td>R3G00PBY5CEKSZ</td><td>B00YZGQ0NQ</td><td>154712218</td><td>Car GPS Navigation 7 Inch Touch Screen, Bluetooth, Windows Ce with Usa, Canada and Mexico Maps.</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>One Star</td><td>Don't work, is peace of shet</td><td>21/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>42599998</td><td>RQ3LS1ZNRLMA</td><td>B0069ZFYCY</td><td>627022964</td><td>eForCity Leather Case for Barnes and Noble Nook Color, Purple</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Great quality and protection.</td><td>21/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13804717</td><td>R3TOU5NTTR8KJE</td><td>B00UPR7TEI</td><td>588370757</td><td>Authentic Ferrari Key Chain</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>Nice product, reasonable price, quick delivery.</td><td>21/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>44732323</td><td>R37HV0M8VT8VAC</td><td>B00X56D8GO</td><td>801679230</td><td>toyofmine SDHC CF Card Adapter Converter for Mercedes Benz PCMCIA Command System UP 16, 8, 4, 2, 32 GB for Mobile Phones Digital Cameras GPS Navigation Devices and Tablet Computer</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Excellent</td><td>Faster and good Ã­tem</td><td>21/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>51711274</td><td>R1TPQNI59ZCZE6</td><td>B0052UBC3M</td><td>460741743</td><td>Sony Walkman Compact Portable Lightweight AM/FM Stereo Radio with Convenient Belt Clip & Over the Head Stereo Headphones - Batteries Included - Designed for Jogging, Walking, Exercising & Bike Riding</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>great product</td><td>this is a great prodct and works very well.</td><td>21/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>46847564</td><td>R1I0DHJ0CRDA8W</td><td>B00CFT2GC4</td><td>808316128</td><td>Mini MP3 Portable Digital Player with T-Flash/Micro SD Card Slot (Red) by AHMET</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>great!

I am now also linking a Iphone 6 and it is so simple from any device.<br /><br />The volume that comes out of this little speaker box is tremendous and I don't say the word tremendous very often but that is exactly what it is! We took this on vacation with us and it didn't take up a whole lot of space, it was the perfect way to listen to music and connect with our different devices.  Great for listening to music on the beach on vacation.<br /><br />The rechargeable battery gives about 10 hours of playtime which I think is decent and the USB charger makes it really convenient!<br /><br />I use Skype a lot and the speaker is perfect for skype calls which means my whole family can talk to my relatives in the UK without having to sit around a computer.<br /><br />My favorite element of this speaker is the ease of use, it only has a few buttons making it super simple to use!<br /><br />I would recommend this product as a value for the price!

I actually bought it as a gift for my dad.  I thought he might like an MP3 player, but I didn't want to get an expensive one because I wasn't sure how much he would actually use it.  Fortunately I opened this one up to load some stuff for him and try it out a bit, but I'm not even sure I'm going to give it to him.  I'm 100% sure he will use it once and never pick it up again.  I would rate this thing as nothing more than a glorified flash drive.  If you want a MP3 player, do yourself a favor, pay 2-3x more and get a halfway decent one.

So it's more emergency, emergency than I really wanted, not even 1/8th recharge.  The other problem is that the button to turn on the flashlight is raised with no cover, and while in my purse while knocking around with other things, it turns on too easily and power is lost with the flashlight on.

And this program is about as far from â€œsimpleâ€ as any software Iâ€™ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  Itâ€™s â€œEZ Nav Route Wizardâ€ is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their &#34;features&#34;, but itâ€™s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, thatâ€™s their way of giving it to you.  However, Iâ€™m baffled by why, if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re after, youâ€™re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says â€œFly to Chicagoâ€.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, weâ€™re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we donâ€™t need the dash of a 777 to do it.<br /><br />If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, youâ€™re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard â€“ so much so that thereâ€™s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but arenâ€™t sure what order to put them in, or lets say youâ€™re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and youâ€™re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stopâ€™s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the stepsâ€¦  make sure youâ€™re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop youâ€™d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Prefâ€™s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a &#34;start&#34; button on the thing. And for good measure, letâ€™s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those â€“ theyâ€™re way too useful.<br /><br />My bottom line for this software is youâ€™re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesnâ€™t do a good job at ANY of them.  Youâ€™re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and Iâ€™m still looking.  If thatâ€™s what youâ€™re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isnâ€™t apparently in this software teamâ€™s vocabulary.  And if youâ€™re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it atall, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software Iâ€™ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.all, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software Iâ€™ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.

I have the original lighting cable that came with my 6 in my work truck and it takes a beating, from being bent up sitting in the cup holder when I use my GPS and when I unplug it letting it hit the floor and drag all over the dirt, it still works perfectly. On the other hand, these iXCC cables by my night stand, only charging my phone for short periods before I go to bed, lasts on average about a month and a half or two months. Weird considering it doesn't get beat up or dragged around and isn't being constantly used like the other one.

Looks like the black plastic ring in the suction cup failed somehow and detached from the rest of mount, the camera itself is fine. Anyway I contacted E-Prance, they were very responsive, and will be sending me a new replacement mount.<br /><br />I had one issue, I brought it into the house, plugged it into my laptop, it powered up, but said there was a error reading the memory card (Samsung) so I tried another card, but same results, I emailed E-Prance, and got a reply the next day, but that morning I plugged it into the car, and noticed it worked fine. Again trying it on the laptop it didn't work, and I realized that I do occansionally have problems with my laptop not having enough power in the USB ports for newer devices, like my 10&#34; tablet. Works like a champ in the car, and plugged into the A/C usb for power, so if you have an older laptop be aware of that.</td><td>19/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>30578494</td><td>R216CTAZAC00GJ</td><td>B0125TAQUW</td><td>342310746</td><td>Avalon Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 Speaker with Suction cup and Bicycle Clip, Black</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Awesome speaker!</td><td>Great speaker especially for the value!

I took the mp3 to work the next day and the device only worked for around two hours as the battery life had depleted. I immediately put this item on charge after use as i thought it might not have charged correctly, however after trying it the next day i powered up the device and straight away it turned itself off after a few moments. I have also noticed that the centre button is not working at all. Really disappointed with this item and i would highly recommend to anyone considering this as a purchase to look elsewhere and spend a little bit more cash or find another device as this item is really rubbish and really not worth wasting 20 dollars and now i have an item that no doesn't work.</td><td>19/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>18658991</td><td>R18XCATLOMK81E</td><td>B00M644CKC</td><td>980752489</td><td>Mgotu MINI Drilling Waterproof Flush Mount CCD Car Rear view Back Up Reverse Parking Camera For SUV MPV TRUCK(18.5 mm), With Guide Lines</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>worth it for the price.</td><td>[[VIDEOID:a65fdadaac0fc343c28aa50c116b0677]]I have always wanted to have a rear camera for our car since I am a beginner in driving. I know how expensive it can get to have it added as a feature in your car if you are to go to a service center. Now my wish is granted, I have this camera in our car with decent price. If you are not inclined with wirings and stuff in the car it will be hard for you to install this. We installed it to where when you put the car in reverse, the monitor will turn on and this will give the view. My husband really likes this! It gives a good view at the back and keeps everyone safe when backing up. It works well at night too. If only I knew that putting a rear camera isn't that costly I would have done it long time ago. We haven't tested it under rainy condition since it hasn't been raining in California lately. But I will definitely give you an update after we tried that.

The bass really is amazing, though, with the sound up high you can really feel the thud in the music when the low note hits. My sister even said she was thinking about buying one herself! On top of the device are play / pause, Volume Up and Volume Down buttons.<br /><br />Now the problem, which was pretty small, so I couldn't decide what to say here. The speaker automatically connects to the last paired device when turned on, and if you turn off the Bluetooth on a connected device, you have to restart the speaker to get the device back into pairing mode. I also compared this small issue with a Skullcandy Soundmine, which had the same problem. This is a small problem compared to the many connection methods, great design, and great sound quality.<br /><br />Adding this as an afterthought, the speaker is smaller than expected, but still just as loud.</td><td>19/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>5443541</td><td>R8APCJP6ZGVP8</td><td>B009CRMABY</td><td>71624801</td><td>ZHOLÂ® NEW Am-fm Hidden Windshield Antenna Car Radio Truck</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Works great for me</td><td>Good reception, easy to install.</td><td>19/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>48497399</td><td>RLFXZRZZ4K9GD</td><td>B00WR0GAUK</td><td>383987857</td><td>Campark 4.3\" HD 1920x1080P Car Rear View Mirror Camera DVR Dual Lens Back up G-Sensor</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>3.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Easy setup (although I had to figure out the button ...</td><td>Easy setup (although I had to figure out the button controls by trial and error).

All-in-all, it serves the purpose of having documentation of things happening in front and behind my vehicle.

I personally do not drive down the freeway or down the street in reverse so I only needed this camera for when I back up in a parking lot or parking in reverse which I do maybe 2 to 4 times a day and it usually takes me 5 seconds to 10 seconds max. I was just looking for a camera to make sure I don't hit a shopping cart, a kid, another persons car or a person in a bike cus we all know they never lookout for themselves. Overall the camera serves it's purpose which is what I was looking for, a rear-view camera at an affordable price. I wasn't expecting full H-D when I ordered this and don't need it for something that I may spend a total of 40 seconds a day looking at ,if that. The quality of the camera is good during the day and at night it's pretty good too, I have LED lights for my reverse lights so that does help. I also liked that it had a little grid so I know where I'm going. The camera came with a drill bit to drill the perfect size hole in my car which I really appreciated, it also came with the needed power cable and video cable. For me it was really easy to install since I have installed stereos and monitor in my cars in the past and also have installed audio and video in my home so it took less then 30 minutes and that's only because I'm the type of person that likes to have a nice professional looking install and don't like having wires all over the place. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review but would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a camera to serve it's purpose.</td><td>18/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>18653653</td><td>R1P33J68VQ6OW3</td><td>B00SE92TKS</td><td>620692813</td><td>Mini VCI 16 PIN OBD2 Diagnostic Cable for TOYOTA TIS Techstream Cable V9.30.002</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great, but...</td><td>Item came in decent time (3 weeks) from across the Pacific.

DON'T BUY</td><td>This has the potential to be a great inexpensive dashcam, but two flaws are ruining it for me:<br />1. Despite what the product pictures show, the camera has a BRIGHT silver lens barrel, not the more subtle black one show in the pics. This would be a minor cosmetic issue, except for the fact that the silver barrel makes this SUPER OBVIOUS if you leave it mounted to your windshield when your car is parked. It's like the damn thing was designed to be enticing to thieves. I contacted Amazon about this and they sent me a second one, which (despite the pics on the site and the product box) also sports the bright silver color. Annoying, but fixable with a Sharpie and some time.<br />2. The dashcam broke within a couple weeks of installing it. It works for about 3 minutes before powering off completely, and refuses to power up again until the power cord is completely disconnected and re-inserted (hardly safe while driving). I've heard good things from trusted sources about this camera so I'm hoping this is just a fluke and hopefully the soon-to-be-received replacement will be awesome, but this early and sudden failure (coupled with the issue noted above) doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Wanted to provide an update. About ~15 months after purchasing the original and then getting the replacement because the 1st one was DOA, the second camera is broken. It powers on and I can &#34;use&#34; it as you'd expect, but it no longer records reliably to memory cards (I've tried with different known-good cards formatted in-camera). Super frustrating to find out that it stopped recording files to the card months ago, despite all the icons on the LCD display indicating everything is working fine. Naturally it is just outside the manufacturers warranty now, so I've got an $89 paperweight. I strongly encourage you to skip this camera and buy something else - this one is junk. :-(</td><td>17/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>28710645</td><td>R35Z3EQEEDOW65</td><td>B00XTLMKX2</td><td>438245684</td><td>Silicone Case for Microsoft Lumia 640 XL - X-Style blue - Cover PhoneNatic + protective foils</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>It fits perfectly!

It is also partly my fault that I didn't do a little more research before purchasing the product.<br /><br />Pros<br />-The bluetooth connection is awesome. Gives you the ability to listen to pandora and any other music app through your phone. When I use the mic to talk on the phone through the car, people are amazed at the quality of my voice. Im glad that this unit is so clear.<br />-You can play DVD's.....<br /><br />That's as far as I can go with the standouts.<br /><br />The issue i have for this is that, I cant really imagine many people using the DVD feature anymore, considering DVD or any kind of CD device is outdated technology, especially if you have a smart phone that you are connecting to this device. I bought this unit thinking I might be able to play youtube, and other video files on the screen. ONCE AGAIN PLAYING VIDEO/MEDIA FILES FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE CANNOT BE DONE WITH THIS UNIT! I have to capslock that statement in case people are thinking that this 2015 model unit would have that feature.<br /><br />In my defense I searched the pioneer's main website prior to purchasing to get some more details about this product. It had a little ad that showed the phone app that you can download to use with pioneer headunits. I mistakenly took that ad as a feature for this specific unit. That app does not work for this unit, unless someone can show me otherwise.<br /><br />Hope this helps a few of you guys.</td><td>17/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>6396777</td><td>R2HXDQ10CW6QJW</td><td>B00J46XO9U</td><td>744008282</td><td>iXCC Lightning Cable 3ft, iPhone charger, for iPhone X, 8, 8 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 6, 6 Plus, SE 5s 5c 5, iPad Air 2 Pro, iPad mini 2 3 4, iPad 4th Gen [Apple MFi Certified](Black and White)</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>They work great!</td><td>17/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>14324509</td><td>R2SBDZLSOO0XHS</td><td>B00OX52T1Q</td><td>86915277</td><td>Clip-Dat Blue Mini Clip MP3 Player w/ Black Button - Assembled, QC Tested, & Imaged by FairlyAdept -  Same Day Processing</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>4.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>when they finally go bad, I will recycle them</td><td>Got 3 of them, all work as advertised, when they finally go bad, I will recycle them.

Some lasted 3 days: none served me for more than a month before breaking.  And most cost at least twice as much as this gold all-metal BT speaker that looks like the interchangeable lens for an SLR camera.<br /><br />In short, this is the only non-brand, inexpensive BT speaker that I could recommend and that I might give as a gift.  The audio quality is loud enough and decent for a speaker of this size, and the speaker has proven durable, lasting me for an entire year.<br /><br />Of course, there are a few caveats: You should not expect to hear much bass (or, for that matter, anything close to full-frequency sound).  Also, any reference to an FM radio is unlikely to have any relevance in the West, where all you're likely to receive is static.  Finally, my &#34;pre-2014&#34; version of this speaker charges with a &#34;mini SD&#34; connector (commonly used to transfer images from a digital camera to computer) instead of the more common &#34;micro SD&#34; connector.</td><td>17/08/2015</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>34446441</td><td>R1E8NAV25W65ZN</td><td>B00MJCDPM2</td><td>754171872</td><td>Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black)</td><td>Mobile_Electronics</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>My favorite speaker for the price- you can't go wrong!</td><td>Whenever I review an electronic, especially one dealing with audio output, people always wants to compare a high end unit to a value brand, when, in fact, its apples to oranges.I don't use my Infinity One portable speaker for the same sound output, situations, or locations as I do my JBL Charge 2. While part of it has to do with one being valued at almost triple the other- the majority of my reasoning is in the strengths one device has over the other. And yes, even in a much lower end device you are bound to find applications more suited to a $100 speaker than a $300 one. While one may deliver crisp expansive audio, the other may have a significantly longer battery standby life, for example.<br /><br />Primarily, for us, this bluetooth speaker has an appeal in the range of features it boasted at such an expendable price point. No one wants to hear their product is 'expendable,' but our brand loyalty to Sentey comes mostly from their execution of easy to use, functional, gaming products under a $50 price point. The convenience of Bluetooth devices lie in the portability of the product, and the vary nature of being portable puts a tech device in harms way from circumstances such as theft, water damage, and improper use (especially if your devices are used in communal circumstances.) While I would love to take my Infinity One to work at the marina and in the golf cart, my paycheck can't afford any mishaps around water or sticky hands from teenage skateboarders. In that case, I desire portable audio that is quick to setup, long lasting in life, and durable in design- with a price point under $50- so here we are testing the Sentey Bluetooth 4.0:<br /><br />Yays:<br /><br />*We always start with packaging- This speaker looks like it could have just come off Best Buy's shelf- It was packaged in a sturdy box inside an outer packaging sleeve. Not only did the box seem like it could withstand shipping and even continual storage, it was colorful and informative, something you don't often see in a value tech brand.<br /><br />*The design is very attractive- many 'bargain' bluetooth speakers come in bright gaudy colors that look and feel cheap- or targeted towards tweens. The slick black facing and 360 speaker design is very modern and style friendly for any geographic or setting. I love how the buttons on the top are inlaid under the rubber coated material so the speaker's operation is quite intuitive and seamless. While this speaker is not waterproof in a sense it could fall into water, the buttons on the top are all beneath the facing, so one could handle it with damp or wet hands without worry (this would be great in a kitchen when working on a recipe.)<br /><br />*This speaker includes a complimentary carry case, which you will want to use because the rubberized top and bottom coating seems to scuff easily. The case fits a little snug and has a drawstring close.<br /><br />*A big plus for me was the ability to play while plugged in- and the device even seemed to maintain or gain a charge while playing and charging. This mainly means I can use it as a stationary speaker in my office for an entire day without having to fuss with it.<br /><br />*Bluetooth pairing was quick, my devices located it on the first scan and there was no searching or fancy button configurations- simply turn it on and put your streaming device in Bluetooth discovery mode.<br /><br />*The product advertises up to 33 feet of connection thanks to Bluetooth 4.0 technology. This is a direct line of path claim- with minor obstructions such as furniture and a dresser, we maintained about a 15 foot connectivity. I COULD keep connectivity through the wall but this was a pretty direct proximity, best estimated at 8 to no more than 10 feet. When outside with no obstructions we successfully measured 30 feet of crisp, uninterrupted transmission.<br /><br />*I like that there is a direct on/off switch so there is never confusion about whether the speaker is on or off- this helps save battery life.<br /><br />*Speaking of battery life- This DOES have exceptional battery life for the value and clarity. On a full charge of Bluetooth wireless radio app streaming we've clocked 7 hours and 50 minutes play time.<br /><br />*The sound is stereo with 2 5 watt drivers for 10 watts total at about 125-250hz audio output. The bass on this speaker is fairly impressive for the price and size but not the same caliber as high output speakers you'd find over $200. In general, this speaker does beautifully with layered audio and instrumental heavy tracks- vocals can sound a little tinny at times (illustrated on the devices bluetooth calling feature) but in general what this device lacks in precision clarity (and don't get me wrong, it's great audio for the price range) it makes up in volume. Oh so very much volume. I can fill an entire veranda or pool deck with the output from this single portable speaker.<br /><br />Mehs:<br /><br />*While it seemed to turn 'on' out of the box, it would not pair- This is because it had no prior or residual charge. In general it's a pet peeve of mine when electronics don't include batteries, or a partial charge. No one wants to open a gift and have to wait hours to play with it.<br /><br />*Charge time from empty to full was long for a device of this size and output- it took nearly 3 hours (2 hours 45 minutes) to charge out of the box.<br /><br />*The upper and bottom material is a rubberized grip that is soft and slick but seems to scuff very easy.<br /><br />*The included cables aren't the highest quality or length. If you are an audiophile you likely have better quality cabled laying around- the charging cable, in particular fit a little snug for my liking. We use our own cables for aux and charging.<br /><br />*This claims to deliver big sound without the bulk- I feel it is one of the more bulky bluetooth speakers I own, especially for amp and bass output. Bulky can be a good thing, especially when you plan on using the speaker outdoors ad in social stations often. Bulky, in this case, also means it has weight in the hand and feels like it is built well- however, it certainly is not a dainty speaker.<br /><br />*It's hard to determine when you are done charging the speaker, and there's no real way to know how many hours or what percentage of battery life you have left. A visual queue or different colored light/patterns would be nice.<br /><br />In summary, this product performs at a believable range for it's list price of $69, and we've found it a great deal for the current asking price of $34 with prime. I like that this speaker has more of a presence than some of other other 'micro and portable bluetooth audio options and feel confident enough in the product that I would gift one to any casual to moderate music lover. I received a product discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts and experiences, which I have done.for the value and clarity.

buyer of wellover  baofeng radios and counting for the group i belong to not all of which were purchased through amazon but many were i am always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being newer or better than other models or perhaps to give them the benefit of the doubt they just do not know any betterbr br first the baofeng uv5r series including the original and still extremely popular uv5r i will explain why in a minute is what is normally referred to by many as a sdr radio or software defined radio  while not a true sdr product you cannot use it with your computer to control the radios functions or scan a wide amount of vhfuhf frequencies with it none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio  that chip determines what capability the radio itself can performbr br every uv5r series radio has the ability to transmit from  mhz on vhf and from  mhz on uhf in both narrowband and wideband modes very useful for the occasional frs or murs use which requires narrowband mode to work correctlybr br every model does at least 4w on vhfuhf from the factory but occasionally you will get a batch that does 45w or even 5w out but the difference between 4w and 5w is minimal at best  a 4w radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5w radio with the standard crappy antenna that baofeng ships on all including the uv5ra 5rax and 5rax modelsbr br baofeng does not program those chips any differently for the uv5r vs any other uv5r series including the uv5ra  version  of the firmware which is the most current release i have in any of my radios works exactly the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the  release over a year ago so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features at least from a users perspective is simply bogus since the firmware inside both radios have the same features  in fact my uv5r radios with the  firmware release is exactly the same radio inside and within the firmware as my uv5ra radios with the  firmware releasebr br second you cannot in any way upgrade the firmware unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply bogusbr br third you can believe that two thinner pieces glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the uv5ra is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic on the original uv5r series if you like and maybe it is but i have not seen that in realworld use from my own uv5ra units  the standard uv5r units that we use seem to hold up just as well when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill as any other baofeng radio we own and usebr br fourth and my biggest issue with all of the nonstandard uv5ra uv5rax and uv5rax units is that none of the baofeng battery accessories except the little  mah standard battery work without modification unless you use a dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard uv5r  but will not work on your uv5ra uv5rax or uv5raxbr br getting new uv5ra units that do not work with extended  mah batteries without modification does not make my group happy  that may not bother you but none of the sellers of the nonstandard uv5ra uv5rax and uv5rax units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings so buyer bewarebr br btw none of the aa or aaa battery shell packs work on the uv5ra uv5rax or uv5rax units either so that is 3 different battery accessories including the  mah extended battery that you cannot use on these radios without hacking them with a dremel tool but they all work without modification on the original uv5r unitsbr br so if you want a pretty radio as my wife calls it buy one of the various versions of the uv5ra or 5rax or 5rax with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you will be modifying all of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work  oh you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark just the thing you do not want for night usebr br virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard uv5r and giving the uv5ra 5rax or 5rax to the wife or kids since the wife andor kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they the wife and kids tend to like the pretty radios but again there is no internal difference and no extra features in the uv5ra 5rax or 5rax units other than a different looking shiny faceplate vs the original and still wildly popular uv5r which i refer to as the m of radios as all the accessories you match it up with just plain workbr br now you know the real background on these radiosf you want a

buyer of wellover  baofeng radios and counting for the group i belong to not all of which were purchased through amazon but many were i am always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being newer or better than other models or perhaps to give them the benefit of the doubt they just do not know any betterbr br first the baofeng uv5r series including the original and still extremely popular uv5r i will explain why in a minute is what is normally referred to by many as a sdr radio or software defined radio  while not a true sdr product you cannot use it with your computer to control the radios functions or scan a wide amount of vhfuhf frequencies with it none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio  that chip determines what capability the radio itself can performbr br every uv5r series radio has the ability to transmit from  mhz on vhf and from  mhz on uhf in both narrowband and wideband modes very useful for the occasional frs or murs use which requires narrowband mode to work correctlybr br every model does at least 4w on vhfuhf from the factory but occasionally you will get a batch that does 45w or even 5w out but the difference between 4w and 5w is minimal at best  a 4w radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5w radio with the standard crappy antenna that baofeng ships on all including the uv5ra 5rax and 5rax modelsbr br baofeng does not program those chips any differently for the uv5r vs any other uv5r series including the uv5ra  version  of the firmware which is the most current release i have in any of my radios works exactly the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the  release over a year ago so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features at least from a users perspective is simply bogus since the firmware inside both radios have the same features  in fact my uv5r radios with the  firmware release is exactly the same radio inside and within the firmware as my uv5ra radios with the  firmware releasebr br second you cannot in any way upgrade the firmware unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply bogusbr br third you can believe that two thinner pieces glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the uv5ra is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic on the original uv5r series if you like and maybe it is but i have not seen that in realworld use from my own uv5ra units  the standard uv5r units that we use seem to hold up just as well when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill as any other baofeng radio we own and usebr br fourth and my biggest issue with all of the nonstandard uv5ra uv5rax and uv5rax units is that none of the baofeng battery accessories except the little  mah standard battery work without modification unless you use a dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard uv5r  but will not work on your uv5ra uv5rax or uv5raxbr br getting new uv5ra units that do not work with extended  mah batteries without modification does not make my group happy  that may not bother you but none of the sellers of the nonstandard uv5ra uv5rax and uv5rax units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings so buyer bewarebr br btw none of the aa or aaa battery shell packs work on the uv5ra uv5rax or uv5rax units either so that is 3 different battery accessories including the  mah extended battery that you cannot use on these radios without hacking them with a dremel tool but they all work without modification on the original uv5r unitsbr br so if you want a pretty radio as my wife calls it buy one of the various versions of the uv5ra or 5rax or 5rax with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you will be modifying all of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work  oh you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark just the thing you do not want for night usebr br virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard uv5r and giving the uv5ra 5rax or 5rax to the wife or kids since the wife andor kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they the wife and kids tend to like the pretty radios but again there is no internal difference and no extra features in the uv5ra 5rax or 5rax units other than a different looking shiny faceplate vs the original and still wildly popular uv5r which i refer to as the m of radios as all the accessories you match it up with just plain workbr br now you know the real background on these radiosf you want a
